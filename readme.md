# Learning Go

I learned a little bit about Go in summer 2018, but never put my knowledge into practice so I forgot everything. This time, I'm doing something different. Instead of following a tutorial on YouTube or Udemy, I decided to take a more practical approach. 

I started by trying to identify what are the aspects that are important in every programming language, for example, reading/writing input, then I came up with super simple dumb exercises just to make learning more effective. I will surely add more exercises as I keep going. In the meantime, I hope you find those exercises helpful. 

**NOTE**: I'm a beginner at programming, my code is far from being optimized or even good. So you'll probably come up with better solutions than mine :)
