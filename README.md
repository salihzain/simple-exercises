The best way to learn a programming language is to get our hands dirty. In this repo, I share a few simple exercises that helped me get a better understanding of a few programming languages that I had to learn for school, work, or personal projects.

My exercises are super dumb, sorry about that. But they helped me much more than watching a YouTube or Udemy tutorial series (I'm not against those methods at all, they just don't work so well for me).
