# Tic Tac Toe 

**Task Description:**

1. Build TTY TicTacToe using a 2D array as the game board. 
2. Allow two users to play as X and O. 
3. Player X or O enters a move by specifying the location of i and j. For example, to place X on left the first row, second column of the board, player enters 0 for i and 1 for j. 
4. Pay attention to stuff like making sure the move is valid before placing X or O and checking if somebody won or the game draw after each move.  

**Goals:** 

1. Get comfortable with variables and their types  
2. Get comfortable with functions of void, single-value return, and multiple-value return
3. Get comfortable with conditionals, loops, etc...
4. Use primitive arrays in Go 
5. Learn how to read user's input from the command line

Please try your solution before taking a look at my code. You'll learn more that way. After all, my code isn't really that optimized as I'm just a beginner in Go.
