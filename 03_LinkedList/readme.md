# LinkedList 

**Task Description:**

1. Implement a LinkedList in Go
2. A LinkedList implements a List interface
3. A list is a type defined by the following methods (according to Java): 
   1. Add(element) - void
   2. Clear() - void 
   3. Contains(element) - boolean
   4. Equals(otherList) - boolean
   5. Get(index) - any type T
   6. IndexOf(element) - int
   7. IsEmpty() - boolean 
   8. Remove(index) - any type T 
   9. Size() - int
   10. ToArray() - [] any type T
   11. There are of course more methods, but I will stop here. 
4. Define a structured type LinkedList that implements the list interface. 
5. Test the LinkedList. 

**Goals**: 

1. Learn how to use structs and interfaces 
2. Learn how to design receiver functions (methods)
3. Learn how to implement the 10 list operations mentioned above in Go. 
4. Get comfortable with pointers.
