# Tic Tac Toe 

**Task Description:**

1. Build TTY TicTacToe using a 2D array as the game board. 
2. Allow two users to play as X and O. 
3. Player X or O enters a move by specifying the location of i and j. For example, to place X on left the first row, second column of the board, player enters 0 for i and 1 for j. 
4. Pay attention to stuff like making sure the move is valid before placing X or O and checking if somebody won or the game draw after each move.  

**Goals:** 

1. Get comfortable with variables   
2. Get comfortable with functions, classes, objects, ...etc
3. Get comfortable with control flow: conditionals, loops, etc...
4. Learn how to read user's input from the command line
5. Overall, just learning the basics.

**Note**:
This code is written for learning purposes only, as they say, to solve a toy problem. It's therefore not a real representation for my real work. The code I write for work is much cleaner.
