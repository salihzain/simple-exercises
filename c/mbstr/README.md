### Task 
Complete some functions that have to do with bitwise operations and encoding, a topic that I'm really passionate about. Better task description is in mbstr.c

This was a school assignment. Assigned by professor [Sreepathi Pai](https://cs.rochester.edu/~sree). He's an amazing professor teaching us Computer Organization.  

**PLEASE NOTE THAT MY CODE IS ONLY THE CODE WRITTEN BETWEEN FUNCTION WRAPERS IN mbstr.c. EVERYTHING ELSE, INCLUDING DESCRIPTIVE COMMENTS OUTSIDE FUNCTIONS, HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE PROFESSOR HIMSELF.**
